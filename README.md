# PD-Template-2
 
   My initial idea for this composition was to create a starry night scene, with animated objects like a sky, the moon, and stars. I did not have a concrete goal for the auditory aspect of my composition, and I chose to make these decisions as I went along. 
   I began by using a plane with a texture for the starry sky, which I found from an image online. I then added a few of my own stars into the scene, which I implemented using particle effects. The material of these stars uses a glowing star texture, and they are aniimated to appear, grow, shrink, and rotate periodically for the effect of twinkling. I then added a moon in the center of the scene, which utilizes more texture mapping, as well as a height map which determines the lighting of the material from the brightness levels of the texture image. I then tweaked the smoothness and metallic variables to my liking. Next, I added shooting star animations, using sphere objects with trail renderers. As each star falls, it triggers a shooting star sound effect.
   For the audio components of my piece, I currently have a constant triple meter drum pattern that includes kick, snare, and sticks. I also implemented a melody, which consists of random pitches played through a sine wave oscillator. The pitch changes gradually increase in frequency throughout the duration of the composition.
   In terms of my objectives for the final composition, I hope to make a few tweaks to the visual environment and add significantly more elements to the audio space. On the visual side, I would first like to clean up the trail effect on the shooting stars, as it is currently glitchy. I would also like to fix the texture of the twinkling stars to have a transparent background. Although it is subtle, these stars are currently mapped onto black cube particles, which I do not want to be visible. Lastly, I would like to sync the twinkling of the stars and rotation of the moon to specific auditory elements.
   For the audio aspect, I hope to implement more sounds and add a more complex timbre to the sequenced melody. One example I had in mind is sparkling harp sounds synced to the twinkling stars. I could also add a bass and countermelody for a wider soundscape.
