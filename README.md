# Compo 3 Report
 
   My goals for the transition from Compo 2 to Compo 3 were to create a more polished auditory composition, add some refining details visually, and connect more visual elements to audio feedback. I believe I accomplished these goals and more through my research and exploration of Unity functions. 
   Firstly, for the sound elements, I implemented an ambient backing track that begins playing at the start of the script. The volume of the track is automated by a sine wave oscillator at 0.5 Hz with compression and offset applied. I also changed the sound effect used for the shooting stars to a noisier sound, implementing three different pitched versions of it.
   My second goal was to refine the visual elements in several specific ways. Firstly, I wanted to add a glow effect to the shooting stars. I ended up implementing this using the bloom effect, which I liked so much that I applied it to the other objects, as well, to make the sceneâ€™s lighting more lifelike. Second, I mapped the night sky texture onto a cubemap, allowing for greater flexibility with camera movement and maximized immersion into the 3-D scene. Lastly, I hoped to refine the material for the twinkling stars, naturalizing their movement and hiding the black background of their texture. I ended up creating a customized visual effect using particles to address this issue.
   In terms of connection between visual and audio elements, I first scripted the main camera to move back and forth on the z-axis in synchrony with the LFO controlling the amplitude, with the speed set to the derivative of the sine wave. The camera additionally rotates slowly about its z-axis over time. I also animated the moon to move in the opposite z-direction, emphasizing the depth of the scene and the movement of the camera. This effect emulates the idea that the moon is producing the ambient sound, which it grows when we are near it and shrinks when we move away. Another cohesive aspect I added with the refined composition is the sound effect of the shooting stars corresponding with their size and speed. When a small/fast star falls, a higher-pitch sound plays, and when a large/slow star falls, a lower-pitch sound plays.
